# IPV-suicide

This Github serves as a resource for those who wish to use the IPV classifier tool to detect IPV circumstances for suicide, which was developed as part of Julie M Kafka's dissertation (2022). 

A demonstration of how to prepare the NVDRS RAD file and apply the IPV classifier is available in the Rmarkdown HTML file. The concept scores dataset are used to this end, and the RF model is also included here.
