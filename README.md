# IPV-suicide

This Github serves as a resource for those who wish to use the IPV classifier tool to detect IPV circumstances for suicide, which was developed as part of Julie M Kafka's dissertation (2022). 

A demonstration of how to prepare the NVDRS RAD file and apply the IPV classifier is available in the Rmarkdown HTML file (Dissertation_Markdown_020122.HTML). The concept term lists  (concept_020122.Rdata) are used to this end, and the model itself (IPV_Related_Suicide_rfmodel_2022_01_28.Rdata) is also included here.
