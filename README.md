# IPV-suicide

This Github serves as a resource for those who wish to use the IPV classifier tool to detect IPV circumstances for suicide, which was developed as part of Julie M Kafka's dissertation (2022). A full manuscript detailing the development and validation of the IPV classifier tool was recently published in Injury Prevention: http://doi.org/10.1136/ip-2022-044662

A demonstration of how to prepare the NVDRS RAD file and apply the IPV classifier is available in the Rmarkdown HTML file (Dissertation_Markdown_DATE.HTML). To best view the  demo, click the green "Code" button and then select "Download Zip." 
The demo can also be viewed on my website: https://jkafka.github.io/. Just click on the tab on the top that says "IPV-related suicide." 

The concept term lists  (concept_020122.Rdata) and the model itself (IPV_Related_Suicide_rfmodel_2022_01_28.Rdata) are required to run the IPV classifier. You can download those files from here.
